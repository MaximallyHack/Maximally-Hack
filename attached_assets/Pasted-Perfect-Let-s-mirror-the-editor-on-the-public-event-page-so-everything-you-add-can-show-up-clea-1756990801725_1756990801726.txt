Perfect. Let’s mirror the editor on the **public event page** so everything you add can show up cleanly. No backend talk — just front-end layout, components, and states.

# Event Page layout

## 1) Header strip

* Logo, event name, tagline
* Date range, timezone
* Primary CTAs: Register, Join Discord
* Secondary CTAs: Info deck, FAQ
* Social icons row (only show ones filled)

**Mobile:** stack title, date, CTAs. Sticky bottom bar with Register + Discord.

## 2) Hero block

* Cover image or video
* Countdown timer to start or deadline
* Quick facts row: Mode, Team size, Prize pool, Location
* Share buttons

**Empty states:** hide countdown if past end time. Hide facts not provided.

## 3) Tabs

Tabs across the top that jump to sections:

* Overview
* Schedule
* Prizes
* Judges
* Rules
* Community
* Gallery
* Contact

On mobile, convert to a horizontal scroll pill bar.

## 4) Overview

* Short description
* Full description (markdown)
* “Why join” bullets
* Quick links grid as chips:

  * Website, Registration, Devpost, Info deck, FAQ, Rules PDF, Sponsor deck, Volunteer form, Mentor form, Press kit
* Tracks or themes (if added)
* Location map embed if offline

**Empty states:** hide a chip if link is missing.

## 5) Schedule

* Vertical timeline with milestones: title, date/time, optional blurb
* “Add to calendar” buttons for key milestones

**Mobile:** collapsible accordions per milestone.

## 6) Prizes

* Prize cards: title, amount, what’s included
* Total prize pool badge

**Empty states:** if no amounts, show “non-cash awards” label.

## 7) Judges

* Grid cards: avatar, name, title, org, link button
* Optional toggle copy: “Full panel coming soon”

If you rename judges later, the section title can swap to your chosen name without changing the layout.

## 8) Judging criteria

* Weighted list with progress bars
* Short explanation per criterion

## 9) Rules & eligibility

* Age limit, team size, IP policy, code of conduct link
* Simple callout box for key rules

## 10) Community

* Big buttons: Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, Forum
* “Community page” link
* Mini note on response time if you added an SLA

## 11) Media

* Banner image
* Gallery grid (lightbox)
* Promo video embed

## 12) Socials strip

Row of icons with tooltips. Hide empties.

## 13) Contact

## 14) SEO/share preview (front-end effect)

* Proper meta preview shown in a share modal so organizers see how it looks
