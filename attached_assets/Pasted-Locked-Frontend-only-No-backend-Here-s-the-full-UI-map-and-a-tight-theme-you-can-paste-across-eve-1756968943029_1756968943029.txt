Locked. Frontend-only. No backend. Here’s the full UI map and a tight theme you can paste across every screen. Think of this as your storyboard for a complete Devpost-style platform, just prettier and friendlier.

# Goal

A clickable, frontend-only preview of every flow: public browse, event pages, registration, teams, submissions, judging, results, profiles, org tools, plus extras like leaderboards and certificates. All data is mock JSON. Buttons act, but only update local state.

# QA checklist for yourself

* Every screen has loading, empty, error
* All tabs clickable with real content blocks
* All key CTAs visible or disabled based on mock role
* Time-window badges flip the right buttons
* Mobile looks clean, no overflow
* Color contrast passes, focus moves correctly

If you want, I can follow up with starter fixture JSON for events, submissions, and judges, plus a Tailwind color config so you can paste into Replit and start wiring screens right away.
